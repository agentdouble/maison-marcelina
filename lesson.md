# lessons

## successes

- A single `start.sh` entrypoint keeps backend and frontend startup aligned.
- Dynamic CORS from `.env` prevents hardcoded port regressions.
- Keeping the frontend in Vite with a minimal file set preserves speed and readability.
- Keeping a clean git flow (`main` as stable base, then `dev`, then feature branches) reduces integration risk.
- Rewriting the existing `App.jsx` and `styles.css` for the brand mock kept the codebase lean (no extra component sprawl).
- Defining a reusable visual system (CSS variables + section patterns) speeds up future UI iterations.
- Adding React Router directly in `main.jsx` + route mapping in `App.jsx` keeps navigation centralized and predictable.
- Reusing one durable logo asset in `frontend/public/` avoids brittle cross-folder imports.
- Building all requested pages without backend coupling keeps the front refactor safe to ship.
- Building the header mobile-first first (logo row + horizontal tab scroll) prevents desktop-first regressions.
- Showing collections directly below the hero reduces friction versus an extra swipe step.
- Keeping legal/social footer global avoids duplicating links across pages.
- Replacing ad-hoc footer links with a dedicated legal strip improves production readiness.
- Prefer SVG logo assets in `public/` for cleaner scaling and lighter delivery.
- Mobile hamburger + auto-close on route change keeps nav compact without losing access.
- A liquid glass design can be shipped with pure CSS (no extra UI dependency) if variables stay centralized.
- IntersectionObserver-based reveal animations keep scroll effects smooth without heavy animation libraries.
- Full-width page sections avoid the boxed feeling in web-app mode.
- Keep header actions ordered by priority so login stays at far right across breakpoints.
- Creating an SVG wrapper from a PNG is a fast fallback when vector tracing tools are missing, and keeps delivery unblocked.
- Using `magick -fuzz 5% -trim` before exporting a text visual gives a tight, reliable crop around lettering.
- For reliable rendering in web apps, prefer self-contained SVG assets (embedded image data) over external `href` file references.
- Keeping main nav labels centered while preserving action icons in a separate right-aligned group improves clarity without changing routing.
- Replacing text-based utility actions (cart) with icon buttons works best when `aria-label` is explicit to preserve accessibility.
- For premium nav styling, text links with subtle active underline read cleaner than bordered pill tabs.
- On mobile, a framed dropdown container keeps minimalist text nav readable without reintroducing heavy tab styling.
- Frameless utility icons (cart/login) can look cleaner than capsule buttons when the header is already visually rich.
- For a premium home experience, an interactive list + featured visual can replace a static grid without adding new dependencies.
- Home collection autoplay must pause on hover/focus and cleanup intervals on unmount to avoid race conditions and duplicate timers.
- Isolating a complex WebGL/GSAP slider in `src/components/ui` keeps `App.jsx` focused on routing and page composition.
- In a Vite React JS app, importing a `.tsx` component can work at build time, but true TypeScript safety still needs dedicated TS tooling/config.
- For immersive hero sliders, removing card borders/radius and page padding creates a cleaner full-bleed effect.
- Removing numeric counters from the hero slider can reduce visual clutter when title navigation is already visible.
- Centering hero copy and bottom navigation creates stronger visual hierarchy on animation-first homepages.
- Frameless bottom nav labels paired with centered progress lines improve readability without heavy UI chrome.
- Enforcing one commit per atomic change keeps collaboration flow traceable and easier to review.
- On homepages with a strong hero, placing `Piece signature` then `Best-sellers` then a compact trust band creates a clean conversion flow.
- A hero slider should use full viewport height when it is the primary first impression block.
- Keeping home collection buttons frameless (text + line) preserves the premium direction better than boxed controls.
- Keeping post-hero home sections frameless preserves continuity with the immersive hero.
- A liquid morph treatment works best on the image wrapper (not a card container) to keep the section frameless.
- In split layouts, centering signature text vertically opposite the visual improves balance and readability.
- For premium direction, `Decouvrir` works better as a frameless text CTA than as a pill button.
- A shadcn-compatible setup can be added incrementally in a Vite JS app by enabling TS support and alias `@/*` without rewriting all pages.
- Disabling Tailwind preflight avoids regressions when a mature handcrafted CSS theme already exists.
- Moving best-sellers to an Embla-based carousel gives richer interaction than a static grid while keeping routing and data simple.
- Replacing a minimal legal strip with a themed, data-driven footer component improves consistency while reusing existing route contracts.
- Keeping footer copy concise preserves the brand tone and avoids explanatory text bloat.
- Grouping legal links under one footer block (`Informations legales`) reduces visual noise on mobile.
- Aligning `Informations legales` as a third footer column (same pattern as `Navigation`/`Assistance`) improves scanability.
- Reducing footer vertical paddings and gaps keeps legal/navigation content visible without excess empty space.
- On mobile, centering signature visual + copy improves balance before switching to split left/right layout on larger screens.
- Centering carousel card copy (title/price) improves visual balance on portrait product crops.
- Footer copyright rows should use tight `mt/py` and reset paragraph margins to avoid artificial empty space.
- Increasing header logo, nav labels, and utility icon sizes together preserves visual balance better than scaling only one element.
- For hero animated titles on mobile, split/animate by words (not characters) to prevent mid-word line breaks.
- Header tuning works best by reducing logo size slightly while increasing nav/icon sizes for clearer hierarchy.
- For separator styling, keep it configurable because direction can switch between liquid and straight cut quickly.
- For a luxe marketplace page, keep product cards minimal (image/name/price) and move search/filter/tri controls into the hero + chips area.
- For front-only catalog interactions, deriving visible products with `useMemo` keeps filtering/sorting predictable without side effects.

## errors to avoid

- Do not commit machine artifacts (`.DS_Store`, virtual env folders, `node_modules`, local `.env`).
- Do not bypass `uv` for backend dependency management or execution.
- Do not hardcode backend/frontend ports in app code.
- Do not ship placeholder UI copy unrelated to brand content.
- Do not keep empty scratch files in git history.
- Do not overload top navigation when only a few tabs are needed.
- Do not keep decorative controls if swipe interaction already covers the use case.
- Do not assume PNG-to-SVG vector tracing will work locally without `potrace`/equivalent tooling installed.
- Do not use long navigation labels with forced `white-space: nowrap` on mobile dropdowns, or labels will overflow.
- Do not mix centered nav layout with left-aligned tab text, or headers look visually misaligned.
- Do not remove all visual separation on mobile overlays, or navigation can become hard to perceive.
- Do not overdecorate utility icons with badges/background pills when a minimalist header is expected.
- Do not run home autoplay timers without proper cleanup logic, or multiple intervals can desync active state and UI.
- Do not assume shadcn/Tailwind/TypeScript conventions already exist in a plain React project; verify structure before integrating shared components.
- Do not recreate slide arrays inside render for WebGL-heavy components, or effects can reinitialize unnecessarily.
- Do not batch unrelated edits into a single commit; keep commits scoped to one clear change.
- Do not place dense descriptive paragraphs under the hero; keep post-hero blocks short and action-oriented.
- Do not subtract header height from a hero meant to feel fully immersive; it breaks the full-screen impact.
- Do not style home collection buttons as boxed pills/cards when the visual direction is frameless.
- Do not wrap the post-hero home modules in card containers when the requested direction is edge-to-edge.
- Do not apply liquid styling through added outer frames; apply it directly on the media shape.
- Do not reuse generic pill button styles for signature CTAs when frameless controls are required.
- Do not use `@/components/ui/*` imports without configuring Vite alias `@`, or builds will fail.
- Do not integrate shadcn snippets in JS projects without adding TS/Tailwind support first.
- Do not duplicate legal route definitions in footer data; map from existing legal page source of truth.
- Do not spread legal links across multiple footer zones when a single grouped legal block is requested.
- Do not hide legal links behind a separate bottom interaction when the request is a visible column list.
- Do not over-pad footer sections after adding multiple columns, or the page end feels disproportionately tall.
- Do not keep desktop-left alignment rules on mobile for hero-adjacent split blocks; center first, then branch at tablet.
- Do not leave carousel overlay copy left-aligned when the requested direction is centered emphasis.
- Do not rely on default paragraph margins in compact footer rows; it creates unwanted bottom gap.
- Do not enlarge header logo without scaling nav/icon sizes, or hierarchy becomes inconsistent.
- Do not animate hero titles per character on narrow screens when readable word wrapping is required.
- Do not upscale logo and nav/icons in the same direction blindly; tune them inversely for balance.
- Do not force a liquid separator when the requested direction is a straight visual cut.
- Do not keep obsolete collection components/styles after a page rewrite, or old selectors can create hard-to-debug UI regressions.
- Do not expect `npm run build` to work on a fresh clone before `npm install`.
